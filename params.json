In case you have some great ideas, you may just [open an issue](https://github.com/inventid/buckaroo/issues/new). Be sure to check beforehand whether the same issue does not already exist.\r\n\r\n## How can I contribute?\r\n\r\nWe feel contributions from the community are extremely worthwhile. If you use Buckaroo in production and make some modification, please share it back to the community. You can simply [fork the repository](https://github.com/inventid/buckaroo/fork), commit your changes to your code and create a pull request back to this repository.\r\n\r\nIf there are any issues related to your changes, be sure to reference to those. Additionally we use the `develop` branch, so create a pull request to that branch and not to `master`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally we always use [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) for our development. To do the same, you can do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure to have [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) installed.\r\n1. Clone the repository\r\n1. Open a terminal / shell script and nagivate to the place where you cloned the repository\r\n1. Simply enter `vagrant up`\r\n1. Provisioning takes around 5 minutes on my PC. If you want it to be faster you can use the `userConfig.json` file in the root and override the specific settings for memory and CPU.\r\n1. The Vagrant machine provisions and you can easily work with us. Enter `vagrant ssh` to get shell access to the machine. In case you are done with it, simply enter `vagrant destroy`. You won't lose any changes to your git repository when this happens.\r\n\r\n## Collaborators\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank the developers which contributed to Buckaroo, both big and small.\r\n\r\n- [rogierslag](https://github.com/rogierslag) (Lead developer of Buckaroo @ [inventid](https://www.inventid.nl))\r\n- [joostverdoorn](https://github.com/joostverdoorn) (Developer of Buckaroo @ [inventid](https://www.inventid.nl))\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
